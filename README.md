# 🥔 Chips Market Sales Analysis

This project is part of the Quantium Virtual Internship on Forage. It simulates a real-world business scenario using retail sales data focused on the chips category. The internship involved analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and marketing effectiveness using Python, Excel, and PowerPoint.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal was to turn raw retail transaction data into actionable insights for both **business and technical stakeholders**. The analysis supports smarter decisions in **product performance tracking, customer segmentation, and campaign evaluation**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy)** – for data wrangling, statistical tests, and visualizations  
- **Excel** – for initial exploration and file preparation  
- **PowerPoint** – to present final insights and strategic recommendations  

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

### 🔹 Task 1: Customer Segmentation & Product Insights
- Analyzed brand preferences and pack size trends  
- Compared average unit prices, quantities, and sales volume across segments  
- **Insight**: Mainstream Young Singles/Couples bought the most chips; Celica had highest retention %

### 🔹 Task 2: Trial Store Performance Evaluation
- Identified control stores using correlation and magnitude distance techniques  
- Measured trial impact using sales lift and t-statistics  
- **Insight**: Trial stores showed measurable performance differences, with 95% confidence intervals used to validate results

### 🔹 Task 3: Executive Presentation
- Created an executive-style slide deck to summarize findings from Tasks 1 and 2  
- Provided visual summaries and data-backed recommendations

---

## 🚀 What I Achieved

- Applied statistical techniques (correlation, t-tests, normalization) to real-world retail data  
- Developed a clear presentation and report tailored to business stakeholders  
- Learned to evaluate test vs. control store performance using Python

## ⚙️ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Managing long workflows across 3 tasks | Broke the work into reproducible Python scripts and modules |
| Handling missing days in transaction data | Generated full date sequences and merged to find gaps |
| Plotting multi-line comparisons (trial, control, confidence bands) | Standardized visual format and fixed slice logic |

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Focus promotions on segments with high unit purchases (e.g., Mainstream Young Singles/Couples)  
- Monitor trial stores against matched control stores using normalized sales and statistical thresholds  
- Continue testing in smaller, low-risk markets to refine marketing effectiveness
